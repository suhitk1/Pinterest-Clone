# Free Code Camp - Pinterest Clone

This is an example Node.js application that was built for the freecodecamp.com course. The application allows for the user to share their images with everyone on a Pinterest type wall.

### The Web App Does the Following:
* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.
* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
* User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)
